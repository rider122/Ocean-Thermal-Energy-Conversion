Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) for Sustainable Coastal Microgrids

Overview
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a renewable energy technology that utilizes the temperature difference between warm surface seawater and cold deep seawater to produce electricity. Though underutilized, OTEC offers immense potential for sustainable development in tropical coastal regions. This project proposes an OTEC-powered microgrid system for coastal communities, enhanced by AI-driven energy management to optimize efficiency and scalability. The initiative will be developed into a compelling presentation and later transformed into an interactive website or application to educate stakeholders and attract investment.

Why OTEC?
OTEC provides clean, continuous energy, unlike solar or wind, which rely on variable conditions. It also supports desalination for fresh water and aquaculture for food security, addressing critical needs in coastal areas. AI integration optimizes energy distribution, predicts demand using consumption and weather data, and enables predictive maintenance to minimize costs and downtime. These features make OTEC microgrids a transformative solution for energy security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.

Project Scope
The project focuses on designing a scalable OTEC microgrid prototype for tropical coastal communities, such as those in the Pacific Islands or Caribbean. Key components include:





Energy Production: OTEC generates reliable electricity using ocean thermal gradients.



Byproducts: Cold water supports desalination and aquaculture, enhancing community resilience.



AI Optimization: AI ensures efficient energy use and system reliability.



Community Impact: Local training creates jobs, fostering economic development.

Deliverables





Presentation: A professional slide deck highlighting OTEC’s benefits, technical feasibility, and impact for stakeholders (investors, policymakers, communities).



Website/Application: An interactive platform featuring:





Educational hub with articles, videos, and infographics on OTEC.



Simulator to estimate energy and water outputs based on user inputs.



Stakeholder portal for collaboration and investment inquiries.

Vision
By combining OTEC’s renewable energy potential with AI-driven innovation, this project aims to empower coastal communities, reduce carbon emissions, and attract global investment for sustainable development.
